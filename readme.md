## UK Bank Holidays
PHP package to get UK bank holidays.

Code originally found in PHP docs as a comment when I was looking at Calendar Functions when developing a HR system and I decided to turn it into a class/package as I didn't find similar functionality elsewhere packaged up for reuse (and I wanted to learn how to make a composer package for git/packagyst).

Here's the original source of code posted by david.scourfield@llynfi.co.uk: http://php.net/manual/en/ref.calendar.php#77159. Thanks David!
